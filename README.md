# Session-15 Assignment Journey
  1)This is the most memorable course.I learned a lot from this course.Thank you  rohan sir for letting this course at such a affordable     price with hands-on  assignments.
  2)Okay.Now this ReadMe tells the process and steps i followed for this Assignment
  3)Let us start with my journey of predicting masks and depth images if we given background with foreground image and a background image.
# Data
 1)Data is the most important part in the deep neural networks.
 2)So a highly qualified iq brain with millions of neurons will be wasted if there is no knowledge in it.
 3)In the same way if we have a deep learning model with tens and thousands of neurons and weights then it  will be wasted if we have no      knowledge about features,patterns,Textures,parts of object and object(just a basic understanding of model) in those weights.
 4)So data is having utmost importance in development of neural network
 5)Without data millions of skip connections,Millions of receptive fields will get wasted and they would be no use.
 6)So i kept it in mind while developing data from my model.
 7)There are two important steps in the data part of deep learning
    *)Data collection
    *)Data processing in right format so that neural network receives.
