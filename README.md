# Session-15 Assignment Journey
  * This is the most memorable course.I learned a lot from this course.Thank you  rohan sir for letting this course at such a affordable        price with hands-on  assignments.
  * Okay.Now this ReadMe tells the process and steps i followed for this Assignment
  * Let us start with my journey of predicting masks and depth images if we given background with foreground image and a background image.
# Data
 * Data is the most important part in the deep neural networks.
 * So a highly qualified iq brain with millions of neurons will be wasted if there is no knowledge in it.
 * In the same way if we have a deep learning model with tens and thousands of neurons and weights then it  will be wasted if we have no      knowledge about features,patterns,Textures,parts of object and object(just a basic understanding of model) in those weights.
 * So data is having utmost importance in development of neural network
 * Without data millions of skip connections,Millions of receptive fields will get wasted and they would be no use.
 * So i kept it in mind while developing data from my model.
 * There are two important steps in the data part of deep learning
    *     Data collection
    *     Data processing in right format so that neural network receives.

 ## Data Collection
 * So we now understood the importance of data.So now we will look into data collection.
 * Here initially i started with collection of background images.
 * I collected images the next day and send it to my team.
 * But my team members said that the images are not realistic and we are looking for some indian scene photos.
 * So i stared collecting the photos of indian backgrounds with my team mates for assignment 15A.
 * So the foreground object we choose is cow which is the most common animal on roads.
 * So we collected the Background images which are of some indian street photos which were covered with plastic, waste,roads and traffic     etc.
 * We filtered some of images and we spent msot of time for making the background more realistic.
 * Here are some of the images we collected for Background.
